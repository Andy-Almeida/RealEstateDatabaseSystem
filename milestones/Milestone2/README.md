# Discord Bot (25 points)

In this milestone, students will create a Discord bot that will serve as a bridge interface between their database system they created in milestone 1 and the user. The main goal of this milestone is to transform the data (output from your business rules) into knowledge to meet the user needs. 

# Getting Started

Bots are really popular (and sometimes necessary) in modern apps because they can be used to automatize processes, 
automatically handle data from storage systems (e.g databases), and provide specific services to the user of the app.
For instance, Nina's bot -- the one I created to manage my discord server --  saves me a 
lot of work and it is capable to handle basic requests from students. 

In this milestone, students will be building their own Discord bot using their database design created in milestone 1. Your bot must connect 
to your database system to solve some business problems on the scope of your database system design. 

Note that students are free to choose their favorite programming language to create this project as long as the programming language of their choice provide the proper connectors and capatibilities to connect the code to your remote MySQL database. In addition, there will be some code provided by the instructor in Python to help students to get started with this project. However, here is a list of useful resources (for students using a different programming language other than Python) that will help with the development of the bot for this milestone

## Checkpoint VIII: Bot Setup  (3 points)

Let's get started with the setting up of your Discord server. In this section you will create a Discord server and will set up a Bot to be used in this server.

### Discord Account

If you do not have a Discord account yet, create a new one [here](https://discord.com). If you already have a Discord account,
then ignore this step

### Creating a Discord Server (Technically Know as Guild)

We'll use a Discord server as the user interface between out Bot and the user. 

1. Head to the discord [home](https://discord.com) page and sign in (if needed) using your Discord account
2. On the left hand panel, select select the + icon to add a new server 
3. It will prompt two options, select "Create Your Server", and provide the following name to your server 
"<your sfsu username>Server". For instance, my server would be named "jortizcoServer"
4. Create the following channels in your Discord Server:
   ```
      #commands 
      #business-requirements
      #tests-reports
    ```
5. In the ```#commands``` channel write the list of commands that the bot needs in order to solve each one of your business rules, and also add there some real examples about how to run those commands. (similar to what I did with my NinaBot in #bot-commands channel)
   
   
   Examples of Bot Commands:
   
   Note that the following examples are only ilustrative. You are not allowed to reuse them for your project. Also keep in  
   mind that some of your bot commands will take user input. In your tests.sql, students implemented their business requirements based on the assumption that such conditions were static such as "WHERE GPA = 3.0". However, in this project, students must let the user choose the condition of 
   the query entered right after the bot command, this also will require implementation of techniques to avoid SQL injection attacks comming from the 
   user.


        * /number-students-gpa-greater-than \<gpa\> (i.e /students-gpa-greater-than 3.0)
        * /number-students-dropped
        * /avg-grade-per-course
        * /number-exams-per-course
        * /prerequisites-for \<course\> (i.e /prerequisites-for CSC675)
        * /enroll-student \<sid\>, \<name\> <course> (i.e /enroll-student 123456789 Jose Csc675)  
   
 

6. In the ```#business-requirements``` channel copy and paste your approved business requirements from milestone 1 section VII

7. For now, leave the ```#tests-reports`` channel empty. 

### Discord Application 

A Discord application allows the user to interact with the Discord API. As many other APIs, 
you'll need to provide authentication and permissions. Applications in Discord are a high level abstraction to provide
communication between the Discord API and your Bot. 

1. In your [Discord Develpper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), click on the "New Application" button
to create a new application. 
2. You'll be prompted to enter the name of the application, create the following name "CSC675M3" for your application, and
save the changes. 
3. Next, you'll be able to see all the information about your new application.  

### Discord Bot 

Once an application has been successfully created, it is time to create your Bot user. The job of the Bot user is to 
react to certain events and command triggered by the user.  

1. Head to the left panel of your application in your [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
and select the tab "Bot", and click on the "Add Bot" button found on the right panel of the bot tab. 
2. After the bot is successfully created, edit the name of your bot. Set the new name to "CSC675<your sfsu username>Bot"
where your SFSU username is the name before the @ in your SFSU email. For instance, if I were to create a bot, I would 
name it "CSC675jortizcoBot" (without quotes) because my SFSU email is jortizco@sfsu.edu. 
3. Click on reveal the Token link that is located below the username field of your bot, this token will be used later to provide authentication when the bot needs 
to access to the Discord API of your application. We'll use this token later when coding the Bot.  
4. Save all the changes 


### Adding your Bot to your Server

Finally, we'll finish the set up of our application by registering our Bot to our server. Note that the Bots use the 
[QAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/), and we need to set up the Bot to use that protocol. 

1. Head again to your application [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click in your application. 
2. Head to the left hand panel of your application and select the QAuth2 tab. This tool will authorize the use of Discord APIs for your bot using your 
application's credentials 
3. On the right panel, set the authorization method to "In-app Authorization" and then in "scopes" check the "bot" checkbox. 
4. On the same panel, head to "Bot Permissions" and allow "administrator" permissions for your bot. Also, set up all the "Intents" permissions properly.
5. Copy and paste the client id that can be found in "Client Information". 
6. Use the following link https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot and replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE in the url with the client id from (5)

### Hosting your Database Remotely

First of all, students must host their database model remotely (localhost is not allowed in this milestone). Students are 
free to choose the hosting server to host their databases. Some examples of remote host where you can host a relational database for free are [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/database/?trk=c0fcea17-fb6a-4c27-ad98-192318a276ff&sc_channel=ps&sc_campaign=acquisition&sc_medium=ACQ-P%7CPS-GO%7CBrand%7CDesktop%7CSU%7CDatabase%7CSolution%7CUS%7CEN%7CText&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!548665196301!e!!g!!amazon%20relational%20db&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3K2XBhAzEiwAmmgrAoE1SvlDFAECMaxijNoBwdjfg6U6GcmNkrqIVqPruWdH2TxNSS5N9xoCJ_oQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!548665196301!e!!g!!amazon%20relational%20db), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/). Note that in the remote database host of your choice, you must have permissions to run stored SQL triggers, procedures and functions. 

Once the cloud instance to host remotely your database is set up, create a database there and configure it properly to allow external connections. Once created, connect to your remote database from MySQLWorbench and run from there your databasemodel.sql script to create the tables in your new remote database. In addition, and after creating your tables, run the inserts.sql script from MySQLWorbench to populate your remote database with data.

Once your database has been created and populated with sample data in your remote host server. You'll need to write down somewhere (this will be used later) the following info provided by your database host server.

• The host url 

• The name of the database 
    
• Your db username 
    
• Your db password 

*** IMPORTANT: please refrain from spending money to host your database remotely. All the most popular cloud host servers (but Heroku) offer free trials accounts that are free as long as you don´t use any paid features or increase the resourses needed. For this project, you won´t need any special feature or resource from the remote host. Note that the the university, CS department and the course´s instructor are not responsable for extra charges applied to your account in your remote server for this project. It is the solely responsability of the student to make sure that your remote database is not using paid features or extra resources.***

### Hosting your Bot in Replit 

For this milestone it is mandatory that students host their Bots in [Replit](htpps://replit.com). That way system 
incompatibilities during the grading process are minimized. Please refrain from hosting your database directly in Replit because it does not offer built-in support for relational databases. Replit only supports <key, value> database architectures which are not the focus of this course.

The next steps will guide you into creating your bot (manually or importing this repository) into [Replit](https://replit.com)

1. Create a new account in [Replit](https://replit.com) (if you don't have one already)
2. Login using your email and password from step (1)
3. Create a new repl app in your account. Note that [Replit](https://replit.com) supports many other programming languages. Choose the same programming language for your app that was chosen in Checkpoint VIII to implement the database, models and tests files.
4. Give a name to your repl. The name of your repl must be your SFSU username followed by "bot". For example, if my SFSU email is jortizco@sfsu.edu, then my username is jortizco, and my app would be named "jortizcobot".
5. If everything goes as expected, your screen will show your new programming environment for your app. Take your time to familiarize yourself with this environment. 
6. Copy and paste into your workspace in Replit all the files in this directory but the "test" file, including your implementations done in Checkpoint VIII for "database" and "models" files. 

### Secret Environment Variables

Your repl app allows you to set up secret environment variables such as tokens, db usernames and passwords. We'll use this tool
to set all the environments variables related to our bot and the database

Head to the left hand panel of your application, and click in the lock icon. 
Once there, set the following secret environment variables and their values 

```.env
DISCORD_TOKEN= dicord token of your bot
DISCORD_GUILD= the name of your Discord server
DB_HOST=       the host url where your remote database is hosted. (localhost won't work here)
DB_USER=       db username 
DB_PASSWORD=   db password
DB_NAME =      database name 
```

The Discord token can be copied and pasted from your [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) 
in the Bot tab from your application. 

Note that you don't need to modify the code related to the secret environment variables in 
"main.py" and "database.py". It is already ready to be used because it is reading
from any value set in those keys. For example, ```host = os.environ["DB_HOST"]``` will save the
database host in the ```host``` variable. 

Now, your bot is ready to be tested. Click on the "RUN" button of your application and if the app runs without errors, you should
see a message in the application console stating that your bot is online and connected to your database. If your app is throwing errors
or the bot is not online nor connected to your remote database, then please revise the process again to make sure no mistakes were made during 
bot setup process. Please don´t hesitate to reach out the instructor for help if needed. 

Once this checkpoint is completed, please fill out the following table with the following information: 

|             Invite Replit Link                |             Discord Link                      |
| ----------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------- |
| add here the invite replit link to your app   | add here the link to join your discord server |

Once the checkpoint is submitted by its deadline, the instructor will use the above links provided by the student to grade this checkpoint. The instructor will put the bot online on Replit, and will join the Discord server to make sure that the bot is online and connected to the remote database.

## Checkpoint VIII: Data Access Object Modeling (15 points)

In this checkpoint students will implement all the backend needed to solve their business requirements from milestone 1. The backend component of this bot will be implemented with SQL, the student's favorite programming language and Database Access Object Modeling techniques which are needed to optimize the performance of your database system. Please refer to your class notes and slides for more details about this topic. 

***Note that any query created to solve your business requirements MUST be fully optimized and MUST implement SQL techniques to avoid injection attacks as defined in the security catergory of your non-functional requirements from milestone 1.***

For implementing this checkpoint, students will code using the files database.py, models.py, and tests.py. Note that if you are using a programming language other than Python, then you will have to change the extension of these files and the code to the one from the programming language of your choice. 

***IMPORTANT: all the backend implementation for this checkpoint MUST be done in Replit***

Once your implementation required for this checkpoint is completed in files database.py and dbmodels.py. Use the file tests.py to implement unit tests that will test all your code implemented in this checkpoint. The instructor and the grader will run the unit tests provided and will check if your code was implemented correctly. However, we'll put special focus on the following components:  SQL implementation of your business requirements, query optimization, SQL injection and object modeling techniques. 
  
## Checkpoint X: Bot Implementation and Testing (3 points)

This is the last checkpoint of the semester and contains two parts; the implementation of the bot, and its testing done by the whole class. 


### Bot Implementation

In this section, students connect their work done in checkpoints VIII and VIIII. That's it, the bot interface must be connected to the back-end where all the object modeling and queries where implemented. Pay special attention to error handling. Your app should work as expected, including situations where the user enters unexpected input. Performing input validation in both, the bot interface and backend components of the app, is a must to get a good grade in this project. 

### Bot Testing

Once your bot implementation is completed, use the class general channel on Discord to share the link to join your Discord server where your bot is hosted with everyone. ***Note: do not share with students the link to your Replit app, only share with them the link to join your Discord server***. Once joined, students will be in charge of testing your bot using the commands listed in your #commands channel. Create a #tests-reports channel in your Discord server so students can report there the errors found during the testing process. Please fix all the errors found by students by the deadline of this checkpoint.



# Submission Guidelines 

***Failure to follow the following submission guidelines in detail will affect negatively your grade.**

By the deadline of every checkpoint, students must have the following in their main/master branch of their repositories for 
this milestone.  

1. In the main README (table of checkpoints) each checkpoint must be set to completed by its deadline. **No exceptions** 
3. Once the bot is completed your Discord server must have the following channels ```#general, #tests-reports, #commands, and #business-requirements```
   * We'll use the #general channel to test your bot 
   * The #business-requirements channel must have all your enumerated business requirements 
   * The #commands channel must list your enumerated bot commands with examples 
4. The links to join your Replit and Discord Server MUST NOT EXPIRE.
   * Note: Do not copy the Replit's link directly from the URL of your browser. Replit has an "Invite" component that will create a link ready to be shared.
5. It is the responsability of the student to make sure that the database hosted on the remote server of your choice is always online and accessible by the bot. If the database is offline by the time we are grading or testing, then we won't be able to grade your checkpoint. 
6. For every checkpoint completed, all your code must be hosted on your Replit app and in this directory of your repository. 


## Grading Rubrics 

I totally recommend (as a good practice) to write readable and organized code with meaningful names for classes, methods and variables. Keep in mind that if you are planning to showcase this project to employers to demostrate your knowledge in database systems, they will appreciate if your code is readable code even if a particular piece of code is not related to any of the aspects of the database.

This milestone is worth 25 points of your final grade, and the grade rubrics are detailed here as follow: 

* ***Your milestone won't be considered for grading if at least one of the following fails***:

   *  All the links provided in this milestone (link to Replit your app and to join your Discord server) must work without exceptions
   *  All the the coding files, main, database.py, dbmodels.py, and tests are must be fully implemented and/or run without throwing errors/exceptions
   *  Once we put your bot online, it must create a connection with your remote database.
 
* Al; checkpoints from this milestone are weighted as follows: 
   * Checkpoint VIII: 3 points
   * Checkpoint VIIII: 15 points
   * Checkpoint X: 7 points
* Students are not allowed to share their own code with other students. Otherwise, the work from all the parties involved in this action will incur into a cheating and plagiarism fault. Please read the course syllabus to learn more about the Cheating and Plagarishm policies stated by our department and the university related to this matter.
    

Good luck, everyone!
